Title: SOD for multidimensional scaling.

Description: Provides multidimensional scaling by gradually reducing the dimensionality and using the resulting stress to re-arrange nodes in N-dimensional space. Stress is calculated from the errors in the inter-node distances, and the sum of the stresses at each node is combined to create N-dimensional force vectors that direct the movement of nodes as the dimensionality is reduced to the desired number of dimensions in an iterative manner.
